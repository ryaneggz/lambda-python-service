# 🐍 Lambda Python Service

## 📋 Project Overview
A lightweight AWS Lambda function designed to serve as a simple web service. This template demonstrates how to quickly set up a serverless API endpoint.

## 🧩 Main Components

1. **lambda_function.py**
   - ⚙️ Core Lambda handler function
   - 🔄 Makes HTTP requests to external APIs
   - 📤 Returns formatted JSON responses

2. **📚 Dependencies**
   - `requests` library for HTTP communication
   - Add additional dependencies to `requirements.txt` as needed

3. **🛠️ Deployment Scripts**
   - `scripts/zip.sh`: Packages your Lambda and dependencies
   - `scripts/upload.sh`: Deploys your package to AWS Lambda

## 🔐 Before Deployment
**Important:** Add your secrets to the repository before deployment:
- AWS credentials (for deployment access)
- API keys or tokens (if needed for external services)
- Environment-specific configuration

Once secrets are added, the CI/CD pipeline is ready to deploy your service automatically! ✨

## 🚢 Deployment Process
1. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `./scripts/zip.sh` to package your code
5. Run `./scripts/upload.sh` to deploy to AWS Lambda

## 📁 Project Structure
- `lambda_function.py`: Main Lambda code
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `function.zip`: Packaged Lambda ready for deployment
- `scripts/`: Deployment utilities
- `.venv/`: Python virtual environment
- `src/`: Additional source code (extend as needed)

## 💡 Customization
Modify `lambda_function.py` to implement your specific API logic. The template is designed to be as simple as possible while providing a solid foundation for your web service.

## 📈 Scaling
This basic template can easily scale to handle more complex use cases:
- Add more dependencies to `requirements.txt`
- Expand functionality in the `src/` directory
- Implement additional Lambda functions for microservice architecture
